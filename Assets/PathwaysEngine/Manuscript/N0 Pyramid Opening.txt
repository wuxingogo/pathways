You enter a strange antechamber. This must be the great Pyramid, neither Aztec or Mayan, they said. It is a sobering moment, being one of eight selected to save the world from the waken god, but more sobering yet is the door that closed behind you under it's own power. You begin to seriously hope that someone else got through this pyramid already, that your team has planted the bomb, and are on their way back down from wherever they are, having already completed the mission. Your lightheadedness begins to fade, but you didn't notice becoming lightheaded. Something about the stale air must be thoroughly unhealthy: when the door closed, all circulation effectively stopped, leaving you alone with the skittering of small bugs in the foliage, etching out a living in the cracked walls - but there is foliage. It must be perpetually dark in here, but there are plants everywhere, climbing the walls and burrowing through the stone. You hack at one with your knife, only to find it's as real as any plant you've encountered. There are a lot of things that are severely out of place in this pyramid, and it's disconcerting. You see a faint light down the hallway, and a larger hall.
