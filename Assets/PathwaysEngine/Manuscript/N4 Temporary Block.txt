You see some stairs going up, but you can't get there. Even though there ARE stairs here, you can't go up them, because the developer didn't put anything at the top. Now, all you can do is wait for another build. You feel strangely comforted, as though a large weight has been lifted from your shoulders. You realize that the amount of time since you were here last has been so long that the Developer MUST have made significant progress with the engine, and that he must be very near to the next stage of development, which would be level design. You turn back, contented. (Take a hint and quit.)
