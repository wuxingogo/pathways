Originally, Pathways was a mix between a text adventure (like Zork) and an action-based, kill-everything-in-sight shooter (like Doom). It was conjured in 1993 by Jason Jones (et. al), one of the founders of a nascent game development corporation called "Bungie", and as of 2014, they need no introduction.
This modern incarnation of Pathways has been made in the same spirit as the original, which has involved a lot of programming in the dark, on my part. I justify all this thinly-veiled intellectual property infringement with a genuine concern for the memory of the game : I think it would be quite a shame if this early, complex, and idiosyncratic wonder of a game was overshadowed by Bungie's later works. To prevent history from forgetting this little gem, I have taken it upon myself to recreate it, in all its intricacies and tasteful quirks, in the hope that a shooter/text-adventure cross might inspire some change in the industry or in gamers themselves. I hope to prove that intellectual difficulty is a good thing to have in a game.
