You fall through the door, cold from the blood loss, probably. Was it the weather, or did the fall break something open? <i>Is it really raining, out there?</i> You're not sure about... anything. <i>You were just out there.</i> It wasn't raining, you aren't even wet. It's very dark, and quiet, safe, very safe, and dark...

You wake up somewhere else, and you know where you are. You are inside an ancient barrow hidden deep within a dark forest.The barrow opens into a narrow tunnel at its southern end. You can see a faint glow at the far end. A strangely familiar brass lantern is lying on the ground, next to a sword of Elvish workmanship. And then it all changes again, your vision is blurry, and the room is swirling, and swirling...

Shuddering, you sit up. There is a surface laceration on your inner calf, and while there's some blood in the sand, it's clotted up nicely. You're still dizzy, but at least now you know why. With difficulty, you recall the unfortunate circumstances that lead you to this strange place. Your primary parachute failed, and you were too slow to pull the secondary, resulting in some smaller perforations that you can definitly feel, but that you haven't yet found on yourself. You're conscious enough to take an inventory of your situation. You recall tossing your bent M-16 into the woods, you apparently don't have the bag of clips for it, and your rations are nowhere to be seen. Most of your walk into the pyramid is a blur, but at least now you're here. For a moment, you see a strange bronze lantern, but when you blink, you find your flashlight on, pointing down a narrow tunnel, with your M9 Bayonet next to it. You look at the knife again, and for a moment it seemed to be reflecting some strange, blue light, but then it was gone. It must be some ambient something or other. You pick them up and examine the shiny, 4 meter wide door that closed behind you under its own volition when you stumbled through.
