"It is these that are your marvels? Your achievements, your BEST? These are the things that define you, your people? Perhaps it is not I who lacks self-control, not I who have an impossible urge to destroy. You are here to remove me, to bury my influence with an explosive. Perhaps the relationship is perverted, perhaps more men are less than a single man. Perhaps your aggregate is your downfall, that your mindless stupor can only be cured by solitude. You walk in pairs, with your heads down, less interested in what lies above than what you lie next to. Perhaps this, too, is your shortcoming. Rape and murder give you such power! You beat the other party into submission, your own will for pleasure is greater than theirs is to live. That is good, to you. Never a thought spared for the moment when someone else's willpower outdoes your own, and you find yourself torn by their gut hook."

"You will meet me soon. I am the face of death, lilac skin and velvet hair, your doom, soft, quiet. A heroin syringe, a prostitute, a gun. You will meet me, and my unbounded force. It is out of my will you have endured this wretched place, and it is my dream alone which killed so many previously. You are differentiated, you have found the logic, you have come to see me as not a monster, but a man. You are wrong, I am a monster. I am the most terrible nightmare you have ever encountered. You will endure ten more death experiences before meeting me. Your soul will burn for each one, and you will lose all hope, and regain it when you come to consciousness. Jesus only withstood three. I am Homo Superior. I am your living god, now. Limb from limb, asunder broke your bread, for mine is the kingdom, you love her forever, notwithstanding the fire, heit will do without you, dust to carbon, you are to die again, with malice for despair, and terror for your struggles. You have met the three. What, if not these, remains to corrupt you? I will show you."
