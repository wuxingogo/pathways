That is not a small animal, it is a corpse. It is a deader than dead corpse which has had every living muscle torn from it's tendons, and every tendon from every bone. He lays in a pathetic, cowering sprawl in a massive pool of his own blood. It is truly gruesome. You notice little green stains here and there, which surprisingly, smell even worse. Whatever they are, they probably killed him. In the places that it contacts the bone, it has dissolved his skeleton. You'd perform a litmus test, but that would be disgusting, and you have to save the world from whatever did this to him. You suspect it's one of your crew, but you notice he is a good four inches shorter than anybody who flew in with you on the C-151. There's nothing more you can do for him, so you move on.
