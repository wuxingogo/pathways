There's some powder on the floor in the middle of this hall, and it seems to be phosphorescent. The whole room smells like a volcano, but the plants seem to like it. They've grown into a circle around the oddly-placed powder. You knew there was a perfectly rational explanation to all this flora. As you approach, you notice an absolutely pustulant stench coming from the west hall, rather, the left hall, your compass doesn't seem to have acclimated to this acrid climate, it's limply and drunkenly pointing in every which way. So much for navigation. The pillars that line the hall seem to be exceptionally unstable, as if any force exerted on them would just cause them to crumble. You leave them alone, for now, perhaps you can collapse the entrance when you leave, to contain this sleeping god thing, or whatever you may find in this place. As you walk closer, the rotten odor begins to become much more severe, as though a small animal recently died in the left wing.
